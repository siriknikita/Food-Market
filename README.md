# Food Market
The Food Market is the website built using Flask with interactive and user-friendly design to help them buy the products according to their preferences and needs without any troubles.

## DESCRIPTION
A website for the grocery store "Food Market" has been developed. Python was chosen as the main programming language. The website was created on the basis of Flask and aims to simplify food ordering for people who do not have the opportunity to choose the products they need in person. The developed website has a convenient and understandable interface for everyone.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL Database
- SQL Alchemy for ORM control over the database
## LOCAL USAGE
To use the website locally, do the following steps:
1. Open the terminal in desired folder.
2. Run the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/siriknikita/Food-Market.git
cd Food-Market
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```
3. Open the provided link next to the **Running on** text.
4. Buy any product you want to and it soon will be delivered!
## LESSONS LEARNED
1. A new way of thinking about project structure and the problems I want to solve via developing the website.
2. A deep understanding of deployment, as well as it's importance in the development cycle.
3. Work on the database structure to make the efficiend and comfortable work on the development stage.
4. Usage of new technologies and concepts, such as ORM, MVC and MVT patterns, SQL Injections, etc.
## FUTURE OF PROJECT
In order to grow, I am planning to improve the following concepts of the website:
1. **Refactor the code**: the code structure have to be maintainable and reliable.
2. **Improve database structure**: the important part of the website is the database, which needs to be refactored and restructured.
3. **Safety measurements**: another important thing is safety, and the safety measurements can be improved via advanced ways of Authentication flow, as well as using cloud providers to increase the safety of the database instead of containing it's creation only on the local computer.
